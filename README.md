This is the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' peer graded assignment in lieu of Data Science course by Johns Hopkins University available at Coursera.org.

# Acknowledgement
In this assignment, I used this dataset: Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012. Data were obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# This repository includes the following files
- "tidy_data.csv" - This is the tidy data set which is the result of the assignment.
- "CodeBook.md" - This is the code book required in the assignment. This describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
- "README.md" - This file which is required in the assignment.

# How to Run the code
I suggest to run the "CodeBook.Rmd" file from RStudio. The "CodeBook.md" will not execute correctly if you use the 'Run all' command.
